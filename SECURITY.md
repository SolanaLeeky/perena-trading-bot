## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

When using this trading bot:

### Environment Security

- **Never commit** `.env` files or private keys to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable 2FA on all cryptocurrency-related accounts
- Keep your system and dependencies updated

### Wallet Security

- **Use a dedicated wallet** for trading activities
- **Start with small amounts** to test the bot
- **Monitor transactions** regularly
- **Keep private keys secure** and backed up safely

### Network Security

- Avoid public WiFi for trading activities
- Consider using a VPN for additional privacy

### Code Security

- Review code changes before running
- Verify the integrity of dependencies
- Run the bot in a secure environment
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity

## üîç Security Considerations

### Private Key Management

- Private keys are stored locally in `config/keypair.json`
- This file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- Never share or expose your private keys

### API Security

- Session tokens are stored in environment variables
- Tokens have expiration dates - rotate them regularly
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity

### Trading Security

- The bot includes slippage protection
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Error handling prevents crashes that could expose sensitive data
